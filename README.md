BBRepository
------------

Blueprint for a simple object repository that stores objects to disk using binary property lists.

You can read all about the perks of this approach [in this article](http://biasedbit.com/caf-vs-custom-serialization/).
 
This is a (way) faster alternative to Core Data for those cases where you don't need all the querying power of Core 
 Data and are more interested in the raw speed of operations.
 
Check out the `Docs` folder, specifically `Docs/html/Classes/BBRepository.html` for comprehensive documentation on usage and subclassing to fit your needs. Diving into the `BBRepository` class and looking at the code won't harm either.
