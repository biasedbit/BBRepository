BBRepository
------------

Blueprint for a simple object repository that stores objects to disk using binary property lists.

You can read all about the perks of this method [in this article](http://biasedbit.com/caf-vs-custom-serialization/).
 
This is a (way) faster alternative to Core Data for those cases where you don't need all the querying power of Core 
 Data and are more interested in the raw speed of operations.
